# year-1-memory-management-coursework
This coursework was part of our Operating Systems module, to test our understanding of how a computer manages its internal memory between processes being run.\
The main.java file uses the methods defined in the other classes to demonstrate their functions.\
The task was to create classes to represent components interacting with a computer's memory, including processes, their segments, and one to represent the entire memory available.\
I then implemented the functions, ranging from allocating and deallocating a process or its individual segments into the memory and deciding where it would be, based on the space remaining between other processes, to
defragmentation to optimise the space available.\
This helped me to gain a deeper understanding of how the computer runs behind the code, and how objects can be made to interact with each other.
